<h4>3. Define a premise</h4>
<p>The premise contains the entire novel in just one sentence: conflict and its resolution.</p>
<p>Let's suppose your novel to be about a young man that leaves his small town to go to New York, to make his fortune as an actor. After several failures and humiliations, he finally achieves success. In this case, the premise could be: desire to perform (conflict) and determination lead to success (resolution).</p>
<p>Premise is the guide to the novel: the conclusion must start from conflict.</p>
<p>If the premise is clear, everything comes easier. For example, for our aspiring actor, determination and artistic sense could be revealed in the first chapters, by narrating that during his childhood he passed an entire summer helping his grandmother decorate one of her kitchen walls, creating a huge mosaic of every kind of fruit and vegetable.</p>
