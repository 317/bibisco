<h4>1. Have a deep relationship with your characters</h4>
<p>Novels only work if their characters are believable.</p>
<p>Characters are believable when you can understand the complexity of their human nature: e.g. qualities, defects, contradictions.</p>
<p>Characters that are completely good or completely evil are stereotypes and therefore are not believable.</p>
<p>In order to create believable characters, you must know everything about them: physical aspect, behavior, psychology, sociology, ideas, passions, life before the beginning of the novel.</p>
