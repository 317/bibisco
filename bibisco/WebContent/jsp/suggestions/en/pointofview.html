<h4>6. How is the story narrated? Choose the point of view.</h4>
<p>Each point of view has specific features, with pros and cons. Here you have an overview.</p>
<p><em>First person: </em>the story is narrated in the first person by one of the main characters. The story is filtered through that character's senses and thoughts: this means narration must be coherent with his/her intelligence and vocabulary. The character can only narrate events he/she actually knows.</p>
<p><em>Secondary first person: </em>the story is narrated in the first person by a secondary character, who is not the protagonist of narrated events. This point of view must be used if main characters are not aware of their actions and therefore are not able to narrate their story correctly. The narrator does not know the main characters' thoughts and can narrate only events that he/she has witnessed.</p>
<p><em>Limited third person: </em>the story is narrated in the third person by an external narrator, that only has access to a main character's thoughts and actions. Narration is freer than in the first person and is not necessarily coherent with intelligence and language of the character. The character narrates only events he/she actually knows.</p>
<p><em>Omniscient third person: </em>the story is narrated in the third person by an external narrator, who has access to all characters' thoughts as well as to all the events, past, present and future, including events that no character knows.</p>
<p><em>Objective third person: </em>the story is narrated in the third person by an external narrator, that has no access to any character's thoughts. Narration has a journalistic style. Narrator has access to all the events, but narration must be developed only through actions and dialogues.</p>
<p><em>Second person: </em>the story is narrated in the second person by an external narrator that addresses the reader directly.</p>
