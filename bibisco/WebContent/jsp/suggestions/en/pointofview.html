<h4>6. Come è raccontata la tua storia? Scegli il punto di vista.</h4>
<p>Definisci come sarà raccontata la tua storia, da che punto di vista. Ogni punto di vista ha caratteristiche ben definite, con vantaggi e limitazioni. Ecco una panoramica.</p>
<p><em>First person: </em>scene is narrated in first person by one of the main characters. The scene is filtered through character's senses and thoughts: this means narration must be coherent with his intelligence and vocabulary. The character can only narrate events he actually knows.
</p>
<p><em>Secondary first person: </em>scene is narrated in first person by a secondary character, who is not the protagonist of narrated events. This point of view must be used if main charachters are not aware of their actions and therefore are not able to correctly narrate their story. The narrator does not know main characers' thoughts and can narrate only events that he has witnessed.
</p>
<p><em>Limited third person: </em>scene is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has only access to a main character's thoughts and actions. Narration is more unrestrained than in first person and is not necessarily coherent with intelligence and language of the character. The character narrates only events he actually knows.
</p>
<p><em>Omniscent third person: </em>scene is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has access to all characters' thoughts as well as to all the events, past, present and future, including events that no character knows.
</p>
<p><em>Objective third person: </em>scene is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has no access to any character's thoughts. Narration has a journalistic style. Narrator has access to all the events, but narration must be developed only through actions and dialogues.
</p>
<p><em>Second person: </em>scene is narrated in second person by an external narrator that addresses directly to the reader.
